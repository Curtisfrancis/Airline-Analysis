# Airline Data Analytics Case Study

## Overview
This project analyzes data from a leading air transportation company to address challenges affecting profitability and growth. Using SQLite and Python, the aim is to increase aircraft occupancy rates and maximize average profit per seat.

## Problem Statement
The airline faces challenges including:
- Stricter environmental regulations
- Higher flight taxes
- Increased labor costs
- Rising fuel prices

The goal is to use data analytics to enhance aircraft occupancy rates and identify opportunities to increase profitability per seat.

## Tools and Technologies
- SQLite
- Python 3.1.
- Jupyter Notebook

### Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- json

## Data Source
The data is stored in an SQLite database, containing tables related to flights, aircrafts, tickets, bookings, and boarding passes.

## Key Features
1. Database analysis using SQL queries
2. Data visualization of temporal trends
3. Calculation of revenue and occupancy rates
4. Analysis of fare conditions and pricing

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed
4. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
Navigate through the Jupyter Notebook to see the step-by-step analysis, including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Revenue calculations
- Occupancy rate analysis
- Visualizations of key metrics

## Key Insights
- Aircraft models and their seating capacities
- Temporal trends in ticket bookings and revenue
- Average costs for different fare conditions
- Revenue analysis per aircraft
- Occupancy rates and their impact on turnover

## Conclusion
This analysis provides actionable insights for maximizing profitability while considering factors such as consumer satisfaction and safety. The project demonstrates the value of a data-driven approach in the airline industry for sustainable growth and success.
